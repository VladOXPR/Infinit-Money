# Infinite-Money-Glitch
Simple day trading bot that calculates the best times to buy and sell.

# How to use
The algorithm is structured around moving averages, specifically calculating the 26-day and 12-day moving averages. A buy signal, denoted by a green arrow, is generated when these two lines intersect at the bottom. Conversely, a sell signal, represented by a red arrow, is triggered when the lines intersect at the top. The objective is to assess the efficacy of this strategy for day trading.
