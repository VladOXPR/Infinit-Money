# Infinit-Money-Glitch
Simple day trading bot that calculates the best times to buy and sell.

# How to use
Inside the code, change the balance and shares to whatever wanted. The Algorythm is structured based on the moving averages. It calculates the moving average of a larger amount of data for example 26 days in this case, and shprter span, 12 days in this case. When the two lines intersect on the bottom, it is time to buy (symbolised by a green arrow). When they cross at the top, it is time to sell (Shown by the red arrow). The goal was to find out if this strategy works and if it could be use for day trading.
